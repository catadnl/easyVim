# Vim and EasyVim
What you are practicing on is a port of the real editor, Vim.
In the real world, you'll most likely be working with the editor itself.

Almost every important feature is implemented in this application editor.


## Install Guide & Configurations
At this time, we do not provide an installation tutorial, but keep in mind
that Vim is most likely installed on your Unix distribution.

In the future we may release a unified config guide but for now you are
welcome to take a look at the developers' dotfiles.
