# Basic Movement
Here's where the efficiency of Vim comes from: _not using the mouse_
That is because you lose a lot of time moving and adjusting your hands from the
keyboard all the way to the mouse or trackpad.
Even more so, keeping your fingers on the _home row_ of the keyboard (the one
with _asdfghjkl_)


## Directional Keys and the Home Row
You may be thinking: 'Stay on the home row but still move around with the
keyboard? How can that be possible?! The directional keys are pretty far away
from the home row.'

And you'd be completely correct. That is why Vim users move around these keys:
*h* moves left (because it's the leftmost one)
*l* moves right (because it's the rightmost one)
*j* moves down (see how it looks like a little down-arrow)
*k* moves up (only direction left)


## Finding the Efficiency
You should strive to always keep your fingers resting close to the home row.
Also, we'll find out later how you can ascend from a Vim user to a Vim expert by
forgoing the *h* and *l* keys, but for now they are very good.
