# Selecting
You'll be happy to hear that your current knowledge about Vim (the movement and
navigation parts) is about to be doubled!
After finishing this lesson, you will also be able to select text with great
efficiency.


## Visual mode
Besides normal and insert, a third Vim mode is Visual.
You can enter it from normal mode by pressing
*v* visual mode
*V* visual-line mode

HJKL, word, line, document and anchor navigation commands are all available in
the visual mode. So you now know how to select as well.
Try *v* and *V* to see the difference between them.
