# Anchor Navigation
Motions learned so far help you jump rough distances. Except the *hl* commands,
but those turn out to be too granular.

Sometimes, you want to go to a specific ch@racter!
Like the _,_ _@_ or _!_ symbols above.


## Forward untill
*f{c}* finds the next occurrence of c
*F{c}* finds the previous occurrence  of c
*t{c}* goes until (till) the next occurrence of c
*T{c}* goes till the previous occurrence of c


*find* means stop _on_ the character
*till* means stop _right before_ the character
This is where the utility of the fat cursor comes in play.

Try them with _@_ or _._ below:
email@example.com
