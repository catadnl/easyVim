# Misc Manipulation
We will cover a few more commands that are really useful in real world
situations


*~* change case
*.* repeat last command
The repeat command is a very powerful one - it can also take a count.

## Indenting
*>>* indents the current selection
*<<* dedents the current selection


## Commenting
We do not cover plugins at this time, but there are great ones that handle
commenting.
Also we recommend looking into the Surround plugin.


## Remapping
This is also not covered in this tutorial, but it's a great way to tailor
the Vim experience to yourself
