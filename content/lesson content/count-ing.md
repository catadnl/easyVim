# Count-ing
Now comes a little taste of Vim's power: you can prefix motions with a *count*
in order to repeat them that many times.

3w moves three words forward.
2j moves two lines downwards.


## Motivation
We've leared that we shouldn't press *l* a lot of times to traverse a longer
distance, but use word movement instead (*w*)

Now we find out that we don't even have to press *w* a lot of times to get to a
distance point in the text - we can prefix it with a *count* to reduce the
number of keystrokes necessary
