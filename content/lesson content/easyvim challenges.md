# EasyVim Challenges
To keep things interesting even after completing all the lessons,
we introduce challenges.
They are examples of usage proposed by us in order to sharpen your
Vim skills, or show off what you've got.


## Getting Gold and Unlocking Challenges
Each challenge has a certain difficulty. You unlock that
challenge batch upon gaining enough experience.
Gold is earned after successfully completing a challenge,
or finishing a lesson.


## Challenging a Friend
You can send an invitation to a friend for a challenge you have
unlocked. This will cost you a small sum of gold.


## Completing a Challenge
It's simple: turn the initial text into the target text in as
few keystrokes as possible. We'll show you your key presses
along the way and you can retry as many times as you want.

The users with the fewest keystrokes get the top of the rankings.
