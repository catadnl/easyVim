# EasyVim Lessons
In order to learn Vim's commands, we have structured them in lessons, divided
in chapters based on difficulty and applicability.

## Progressing
You finish a lesson by filling the progress bar above the editor with whatever
instructions it gives (try it now - move a bit to fill it up).
Upon completion, a checkmark appears and you're free to move to the next lesson,
or keep practicing the newly learned commands if you like.

## Unlocking
Chapters are unlocked when you reach the required levels (take a look at your
profile - to see unlocking thresholds). You can complete unlocked lesssons in
any order you like, but we recommend doing them in the provided order.

Completing (filling the progress bar) for a lesson awards you experience.
