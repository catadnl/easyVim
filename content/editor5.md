# Line Movement
Sometimes we don't care how many words there are, we just want to get to the end
of the line.


## Commands
*$* move to end of line
*0* move to start of line
*^* move to first non-blank character in the line

The usefulness of *^* becomes apparent when writing code:

def main(argv):
    name = argv[1]
    if name is 'null':
        print 'Trying to be clever, eh..?'
    else:
        print 'Hello,', name


... or when working with hierarchical lists.
