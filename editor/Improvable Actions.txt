Improvable action := an editor action that works but could have been improved, ie: fewer keystrokes.
An improvable action has an action sequence that triggers it and a suggested improvement.

Action Sequence := sequence of commands done in quick succession.
The sequence is considered over when the user has stopped touching the keyboard for a little bit.
The start of the sequence is the index of the before the first command in the AS.
Then end of the sequence is the index of the cursor after the last command in the AS.

Proposed IAs:
  MOVEMENT

  Horizontal word movement
    trigger: AS containing only left/right directional keys (with optional shift/alt modifier)
             start line == end line, start col <> line col
    improvm: <n> [W] or <n> [B] for right/left (start of) words and [E] for (end of) right word
             where n is the number of words traversed in the trigger

  Vertical movement
    trigger: AS containing only up/down directional keys TODO
    improvm: <n> [J] or <n> [K]

  Anchor movement
    trigger: AS of only directional keys that leaves the cursor right before/after a distict symbol (eg: ?~@ etc)
             and the symbol does not occur between the traversed indices
    improvm: [f] or [F] or [t] or [T] followed by <symbol>

  Start/end of line movement
    trigger: home/end keys
    improvm: [^] or [0] or [$] (won't reduce keystrokes but will keep your finger close to the home row)

  Brackets pair movement
    trigger: AS containing only directional keys starting at one bracket and ending at its pair
    improvm: [%]


  DELETION/CHANGE
  [d] can be replaced by [c]

  Whole line(s) deletion
    trigger: deletion (del/bksp) when the selection is from the start of the row to the end
    improvm: [dd]

    trigger: deletion of multiple fully selected rows TODO
    improvm: <n> [dd]

  Deletion inside brackets
    trigger: deletion where a selection is strictly inside a pair of brackets
    improvm: [di(] or [di{] etc

  Delete to end of row
    trigger: TODO
    improvm: [D]


  SELECTION
  any IAs from the movement section can be included here and preceeded by [V]

  Multiple line selection
    trigger: TODO
    imporvm: [V] followed by <n> [J] or <n> [K]


  MISC

  Case change
    trigger: AS containing deletion of a letter and insertion at the same index of the same letter but in different case
    improvm: [~]
