        w			[count] words forward. motion.
        W			[count] WORDS forward. motion.
        e			Forward to the end of word [count]. Does not stop in an empty line.
        E			Forward to the end of WORD [count]. Does not stop in an empty line.
        b			[count] words backward. motion.
        B			[count] WORDS backward. motion.
        ge	  Backward to the end of word [count].
        gE		Backward to the end of WORD [count].

        A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a
        sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces,
        tabs, <EOL>).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.  An empty line
        is also considered to be a word.

        A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white
        space.  An empty line is also considered to be a WORD.

    wwww  wwwww  ww www ww wwwwwwwww

      2. Left-right motions

      f{char}   To the [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the right. The cursor is placed on {char}.
      F{char}   To the [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the left.  The cursor is placed on {char}.

      t{char}   Till before [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the right. The cursor is placed on the character left of {char}.
      T{char}   Till after  [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the left.  The cursor is placed on the character right of {char}.

      eg:
      abc def?
      f?---->
      t?--->

      def? 123456
         <-----F?
