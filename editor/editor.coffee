    When traversing 'abcd' from left to right -->, the letter we stopped at is 'd'
    But traversing it the other way, right to left <--, the letter we stopped at is 'a'
    Same goes for the next char: on left to right direction, the next char is the one to the right of d
    But on right to left direction, the next char is the one before a

    From the Vim documentation (online at http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#word-motions)
      4. Word motions

        w			[count] words forward.  |exclusive| motion.
        W			[count] WORDS forward.  |exclusive| motion.
        e			Forward to the end of word [count] |inclusive|. Does not stop in an empty line.
        E			Forward to the end of WORD [count] |inclusive|. Does not stop in an empty line.
        b			[count] words backward.  |exclusive| motion.
        B			[count] WORDS backward.  |exclusive| motion.
        ge	  Backward to the end of word [count] |inclusive|.
        gE		Backward to the end of WORD [count] |inclusive|.

        A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a
        sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces,
        tabs, <EOL>).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.  An empty line
        is also considered to be a word.

        A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white
        space.  An empty line is also considered to be a WORD.

    eg:
    This "stuff" is not-so difficult!
    wwww  wwwww  ww www ww wwwwwwwww
    WWWW WWWWWWW WW WWWWWW WWWWWWWWWW
